Q. What are the different datatypes in JS?

JavaScript has several data types, which can be broadly categorized into primitive and object types.


	These are the most basic data types in JavaScript.

	String: Represents textual data.
		let name = "John";

	Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
		let age = 30;
		let price = 99.99;

	Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
		let isAdult = true;

	Undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable, i.e., a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
		let x;
		console.log(x); // undefined
	
	Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
		let y = null;

	Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.
		let sym = Symbol("unique");

	BigInt: Represents large integers that are beyond the safe integer limit for the Number type.
		let bigIntValue = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
		
2. Object Data Types:
	These are more complex data types and include collections of data.

	Object: A collection of key-value pairs. Objects can represent more complex data structures.
	
	let person = {
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Doe",
		age: 30
	};
	
	Array: An ordered list of values, where each value can be of any data type.
	
	let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
	
	Function: Represents a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are also objects in JavaScript.

	function greet() {
		console.log("Hello, World!");
	}
	
	Date: Represents dates and times.
	
	let today = new Date();
	
	RegExp: Represents regular expressions, used for pattern matching within strings.
	
	let pattern = /ab+c/;
	
	Map: A collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type.
	
	let map = new Map();
	
	map.set('name', 'John');
	
	Set: A collection of unique values, where each value can occur only once.
	
	let set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
	
	WeakMap: Similar to Map, but the keys are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to the key.
	WeakSet: Similar to Set, but only holds objects, and objects are weakly referenced.
